# rails-blog-app
this is a fun application. I will create this to understand what is good and bad sides of developing web app with rails framework. Rails is a similar framework to .net, I had 5 years of experience in .net so I will use that experience to build an app in rails, of course I will use ai tools and my .net knowledge.
